# SipMatch Menu 🍹

A **React-based web application** designed for bars in Spain to showcase an interactive drink menu. The app allows users to browse cocktails, filter by category, and receive personalized recommendations through a concise quiz. Built with a focus on **responsiveness** and **multilingual support** (Spanish and English) to cater to both local and international customers.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Drink Menu:** Browse and filter cocktails by category (e.g., alcoholic, non-alcoholic, flavor profile, main spirit).
   -**Horizontal swipe:** Achieve 0 vertical scroll
   -**CSS Carousel:** 80vw cards + 10vw padding + 5vw gaps
   -**Scroll Snap:** x mandatory + center align
   -**Peek Cards:** 10% next cocktail visible (invitation to swipe)
   -**Click in card to show details:** Ingredients & allergens (mandatory by law for bars at least in Spain)
- **Cocktail Count Display:** Shows the number of cocktails available after applying filters, with the number highlighted in gold (--accent) for better UX.
- **Clear Filters Button:** A subtle button to reset category and spirit filters, displayed only when filters are active.
- **Filter Logic Abstraction:** Uses a custom hook (useDrinkFilters) and a FilterControls component for modular and reusable filter management.
- **Recommendation Quiz:** A quick, 3-step quiz to suggest drinks based on user preferences (e.g., alcohol content, flavor profile, spirit type).
   - **With Alcohol:** Occasion + Flavor Style + Multi-select Spirits
   - **No Alcohol:** Flavor Profile + Smooth/Bubbly Texture
   - **Auto-advance** single-choice questions (150ms UX delay). Also, if after q2 there are not enough options (cocktails) to select from, skip q3 entirely and auto-advance to results
   - **Multi-choice** spirit selection with visual toggle
   - **Dynamic options:** render options for Q3 based on occasion and flavor selection (avoids showing NotFound component)
   - **Smart navigation**: Discreet "‹ Back" + prominent "See Results" button
   - **Confirmation flow**: Back button resets previous step for re-selection
- **Multilingual Support:** Fully localized in Spanish and English using `react-i18next` for seamless language switching.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first UI with CSS units tailored for scalability:
   - `rem` for font sizes to ensure consistent scaling.
   - `em` for margins and paddings for proportional spacing.
   - `px` for border-radius and specific width constraints.
- **Modular Architecture:** Organized component structure with reusable components (DrinkCard, Layout), custom hooks (useLazyBackground), and centralized styles in **6 CSS separated files**:
  - `globals.css`: Variables + Reset
  - `layout.css`: Layout + Header + Nav + Footer + Page + MenuPage
  - `components.css`: Buttons + Filters/Toggle + Cocktail Cards + Carousel + NotFound + Quiz Nav
  - `pages.css`: Home, Quiz, Menu
  - `utils.css`: Focus + Skip + SR
  - `index.css`: @imports + Media queries

- `public/sitemap.xml` → Home + Quiz + Menu (2025-11-04)
- OG image → sipmatch-cocktail-quiz-og.jpg (1200×630 px)
- Lighthouse incognito → 100/100

## 🔄 Development Process

This project is built with a modular and scalable approach from the start. Key decisions include:

- **Early i18n Integration:** Implemented `react-i18next` from the beginning to support Spanish and English, avoiding costly refactors and ensuring a seamless multilingual experience.
- **CSS Units:** Using `rem` for font sizes, `em` for margins/paddings, and `px` for border-radius to ensure accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Cocktail Count and Filters:** Added a cocktail count display with a highlighted number in gold (--accent) for better UX, along with a subtle "Clear filters" button that appears only when filters are active.
- **Filter Logic Abstraction:** Extracted filter logic into a custom hook (useDrinkFilters) and UI into FilterControls to improve modularity and maintainability.
- **Cocktails Carousel:** Fully responsive carousel to show full cocktail list without vertical scroll
   - **Click to Show Cocktail Details:** Implemented useEffect with state that reveals ingredients and allergens lists.
   - **Click Outside to Close Details:** Implemented useEffect with event listener in the whole document to close details tapping anywhere outside of the card to improve UX
   - **Card Details (Only 1):** Implemented useEffect with state to allow details shown in just one card, achieving better consistency and UX while browsing the cocktail menu.
   - **CSS Transitions in DrinkCards:** Improved visual UX by using smooth transitions with strategic delays.
- **Quiz Implementation:**
   - **Multilingual Standardization:** ANSWER_MAP converts Spanish/English answers to English keys for precise filtering
   - **Conditional Logic:** Separate filters for alcohol (occasion+style+spirit) vs no-alcohol (flavor+texture)
   - **State Management:** answers, currentStep, lastAnsweredStep for smooth navigation
   - **Auto-advance Logic:** useEffect + 150ms timeout for visual feedback
   - **Reset Pattern:** Back button resets target step
   - **Unified Styling:** .menu-filter-btn for options + navigation consistency
   - **Dynamic Options for q3:** based on occasion and flavor selection, to avoid user disappointment via unnecessarily showing the NotFound component.
   - **UX Flow:** Confirmation -> Progress -> Questions -> Results
- **Quiz Refactor (major):** Extracted useQuizLogic (~200 lines) into 6 focused hooks:
   - **useQuizState:** State, navigation, answers
   - **useAnswerMapping:** Multi-language answer normalization
   - **useCocktailFiltering:** Filter logic after Q2 and final
   - **useQ3Options:** Dynamic spirit options
   - **useQuizAutoAdvance:** Auto-advance + Q3 skip (with useRef to prevent loops)
   - **useQuizLogic:** Orchestrates all hooks (~60 lines)
- **Custom Hooks:**
   - (All of the above hooks +)
   - **useDrinkFilters** for modular filter management
   - **useActiveCard** to control when card details are shown/hidden
   - **useClickOutside** to hide card details when tapping/clicking out of the card
- **UI Refactor (modular):** Extracted components into its own folders for maintainability:
  - `features/drinkcard/`: `DrinkCard`, `DrinkCardHeader`, `DrinkCardDetails`
  - `features/filter-controls/`: `FilterControls`, `FlavorFilter`, `SpiritFilter`, `FilterFooter`
  - `features/menu/`: `MenuHeader`, `MenuContent`
  - `features/quiz/`: `Quiz`, `QuizConfirmation`, `QuizContent`, `QuizProgress`, `QuizResults`, `QuizStep`
- **CSS Split:** 1300 lines → **5 files** for maintainability:
  - `globals.css`: Reset + variables
  - `layout.css`: Header, footer, page
  - `components.css`: Buttons, toggle, filters, card
  - `pages.css`: Home, Quiz, Menu
  - `utils.css`: Media queries + hover
- **Git Workflow:** Descriptive commits (e.g., `feat: setup i18n with react-i18next`) to maintain a clean codebase.
